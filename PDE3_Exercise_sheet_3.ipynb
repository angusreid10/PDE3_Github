    "The practice questions are similar to the exercises in the textbook and in Schaum's outlines Partial Differential Equations. If you are having difficulties with these questions practice using the remaining questions from these exercise. You will get the best from this seminar by working though these examples __before__ the tutorial.\n",

    "The sides $x=\\pm a$ are insulated, the non-dimensional temperature approaches zero for $y\\to\\infty$, while the side $y=0$ is maintained at a fixed temperature $-T$ for negative $x$ and $T$ for positive $x$. \n",
