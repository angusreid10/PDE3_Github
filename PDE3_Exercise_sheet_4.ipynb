    "\n",
    "These practice questions are similar to the exercises in the textbook and in Schaum's outlines Partial Differential Equations. If you are having difficulties with these questions practice using the remaining questions from these exercise. You will get the best from this tutorial by working though these examples __before__ the tutorial.\n",

    "a) Show that the function $\\phi(x,y)=x^2y$ satisfies the 2-d Poisson equation\n",

    "b) Now let $\\phi(x,y) = u(x,y) + x^2y$, where $u(x,y)$ satisfies the Laplace equation $\\nabla^2 u = 0$. Show that $\\phi(x,y)$ still satisfies the Poisson equation (1).\n",
